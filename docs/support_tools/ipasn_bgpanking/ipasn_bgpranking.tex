    \frametitle{IPASN History - Problem statement}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Rapidly figuring out the owner of a specific IP address is a common problem
        \item Resolving that relationship for a massive amount of IP addresses at scale is a medium hard problem
        \item Doing so for a specific day in the past is somewhat more difficult
        \item Comparing the resolution across sources is pretty painful
        \item Doing all that together is pretty much a pain
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
 \frametitle{IPASN History - Objective}
 \begin{itemize}
         \item Fast, scalable, flexible framework to load multiple data sources of BGP announcements
         \item Flexible configuration of the size of the history to keep in memory
         \item Fire and forget model
         \item Simple REST API
         \item Even simpler Python client and API
 \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
        \frametitle{IPASN History - (short) History}
 \begin{itemize}
        \item D4 Project (co-funded under INEA CEF EU program) started - 1st November 2018
        \item A PoC of IPASN History was initially developed in 2012-2013 and only supported IPv4
        \item Was used in production for BGP Ranking over many years
        \item The current version was released initially in November 2018 after a complete rewrite
        \item The support of multiple data source was added in March 2019
 \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{IPASN History - Current status}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Supports Caida and RIPE as data sources
        \item Supports requests for IPv4 and IPv6
        \item Python3 module
        \item Simple REST API
        \item Used in production in the new version of BGP Ranking
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{BGP Ranking - Problem statement}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item There are 10th of thousands of actors on the internet owning IP Addresses
        \item Many of them own a very small amount of IP addresses (/24)
        \item They change name, purposes and owner relatively often
        \item Their security practises are poor, if they ever exist
        \item They are plain malicious and have no legitimate purpose
        \item One way to find these malicious providers is to map them to lists of known malicious IPs
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
 \frametitle{BGP Ranking - Objective}
 \begin{itemize}
         \item Daily ranking of internet providers by maliciousness
         \item History of said rankings over a long period of time
         \item Fire and forget model
         \item Simple REST API
         \item Even simpler Python client and API
 \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

        \frametitle{BGP Ranking - (short) History}
 \begin{itemize}
        \item D4 Project (co-funded under INEA CEF EU program) started - 1st November 2018
        \item A PoC of BGP Ranking was initially developed in the early 2010s and only supported IPv4
        \item The current version was released initially in November 2018 after a complete rewrite
        \item The integration with IPASN HIstory was finalized in February 2019
 \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{IPASN History - Current status}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The public instance automatically loads a couple dozen of publicly available lists of known malicious IPs
        \item Supports the ShadowServer data (requires an account from Shadow Server)
        \item Supports IPv4 and IPv6 lists
        \item Python3 module
        \item Simple REST API
    \end{itemize}
