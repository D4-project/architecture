This challenge originally comes from: http://www.loyalty.org/~schoen/rsa/
It is well worth checking it out first.

Here is the original Text accompanying this challenge:

In the style of the Mystery Hunt and other contemporary puzzle hunts, the challenge eventually yields a specific answer that is a single word â€” but you'll have to figure out how to interpret the decrypted data to yield this word, since the RSA-decrypted data is itself in a non-RSA-related code. I'm not providing any specific instructions about what to do with the decrypted data beyond the fact that it can be interpreted as a reference to a single English word. (The answer word is a common noun, not a proper noun; if your guess at the answer is a proper noun, you haven't solved the puzzle all the way to the last step yet!)

We will be a bit more gentle and give you a bunch of scripts, the most important one being ./script/bgcd.sage
